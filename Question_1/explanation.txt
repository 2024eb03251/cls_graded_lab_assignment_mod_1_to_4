The id command displays my user account information, including the username and associated groups, thereby confirming my identity on the system.

The pwd command outputs the present working directory, while ls -la provides a detailed listing of all files and directories along with their permissions, ownership, and other metadata.

I created the file user_info.txt, wrote the required verification message into it, and then displayed the file contents to ensure it was saved correctly.

The wc -m command calculates the total number of characters contained in the specified file.

I consulted the manual page for the mkdir command to understand its available options. The -p option enables the creation of parent directories when they do not already exist.

Listing the contents of the home directory displays all files and directories in alphabetical order by default.

The grep command scans the log.txt file for lines containing the keyword “admin” and outputs only the matching results.

The uname -r command reports the version of the Linux kernel currently in use on the system.

I attempted to test network connectivity using the ping command; however, the command was unavailable because the ping utility is not installed in the GitHub Codespaces environment, which is a common limitation of minimal cloud-based systems.

The uptime command reports the system’s running duration, the number of active users, and the current load averages.
